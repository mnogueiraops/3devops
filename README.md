## Cloud

Follow our co-workers as they dive into the world of cloud computing. They will explore popular cloud platforms like AWS, OCI, and Azure. Discover how they provision resources, manage scalability, security, and availability, and gain insights into cloud deployments best practices.

## Infrastructure as Code

In their quest for DevOps mastery, our co-workers venture into the realm of infrastructure as code. With tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Shell scripting, they learn to build and manage infrastructure programmatically. Witness their journey as they architect scalable systems, automate deployments, and gain the ability to provision resources efficiently.

## Python for DevOps Automation

Automation plays a vital role in the world of DevOps, and our co-workers embrace Python as their go-to language. Join them as they explore Python for automating various tasks, streamlining workflows, and creating powerful tools. Learn how Python can enhance DevOps practices and simplify day-to-day operations.
