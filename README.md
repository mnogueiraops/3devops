## Cloud

In their quest for DevOps mastery, our three heroes dive deep into the world of cloud computing. They embark on an adventure to explore the leading cloud platforms, including AWS, OCI, and Azure. From provisioning resources to managing scalability, security, and availability, follow their journey as they uncover the intricacies and best practices of cloud deployments.

## Infrastructure as Code

Equipped with the knowledge of cloud platforms, our co-workers now venture into the realm of infrastructure as code. With tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Shell scripting, they learn to build and manage their infrastructure programmatically. Follow along as they architect scalable and resilient systems, automate deployments, and gain the ability to provision and manage resources with ease.

## Python for DevOps Automation

As the story unfolds, our heroes realize the power of automation in the world of DevOps. Python becomes their trusty companion as they delve into the realm of scripting and automation. Witness their journey as they write Python code to automate various tasks, streamline workflows, and create powerful tools to simplify and enhance their DevOps practices.
